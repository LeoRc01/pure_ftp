## Regards

This package is inspired by [dart_ftpclient](https://github.com/Nexific/dart_ftpclient)
and [ftpconnect](https://github.com/salim-lachdhaf/ftpConnect) but that packages haven't been updated for a long time.
And in this package I try to add more features.
(package was implemented from zero and don't use any code or dependencies from the previous packages)
